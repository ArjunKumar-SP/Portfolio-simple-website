            <h2 class="section-two__title">About Me</h2>
            <p class="section-two__desc">I’m a passionate web developer with 3 years of experience specializing in
                front-end development. I have a
                strong
                foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m proficient in building dynamic and responsive web
                applications
                using React.js. I’m driven by the desire to create seamless user experiences and interactive interfaces
                that are
                both functional and visually appealing.
                Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, from small websites to
                larger,
                complex applications, where I've honed my skills in modern web development practices. I thrive in
                collaborative
                environments and enjoy learning new technologies to stay up-to-date with industry trends.
                Whether working solo or in a team, I’m always excited to take on new challenges and push the boundaries
                of web
                development.</p>
